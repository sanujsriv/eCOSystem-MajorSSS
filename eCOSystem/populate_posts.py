        "text": """<p><strong>GATE</strong>(<strong>Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering</strong>) is one the most important and in-demand entrance exam for engineering graduates in our country. M.Tech. in Computer Science is one of the most demanding courses at prestigious institutes like IISCs and IITs. GATE(Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) is one of the ways to get into these top institutes.<br />
                    Every year around 10 Lakh candidates apply for GATE exam and very few of them manage to ace the exam with good score. So the competition is clearly very tough and simply preparing without any strategy will make it difficult to land you into IISCs and IITs.</p>

                    <p><a href="http://geeksforgeeks.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks&nbsp;</a>brings you a complete guide and preparation strategy to crack the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-cs-2019-important-dates-and-links/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GATE CSE 2019</a>&nbsp;with flying rank. We&rsquo;ll guide you through out the whole course, from&nbsp;<em>starting your<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-corner-2-gq/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GATE preparation</a>&nbsp;</em>to&nbsp;<em>how to answer GATE questions</em>.</p>

                    <p><strong>Let us now concentrate on few Important points :</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Analyze GATE syllabus:</strong>&nbsp;Start with analyzing the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-cs-2019-syllabus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GATE syllabus</a>. Start divide and Conquer, try to break the syllabus into sub-categories and do the same with each subject further. It will help you to prioritize subjects and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/important-topics-prepare-gate-2018-computer-science-paper/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">important topics</a>&nbsp;in each subject. After doing this, you will get a clear insight into where you stand and how far is left to cover. Analyzing syllabus will also help you to understand about the important subjects and pattern of GATE exam.</li>
                        <li><strong>Start preparing today :</strong>&nbsp;Time is like money, so spend it wisely. The best time to start your GATE preparation is today, just after completing this read. Just pick one of the subjects you feel good and start the preparation. You may start with some easy and scoring subjects like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dbms/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DBMS</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-systems/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Operating Systems</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-network-tutorials/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Computer Networks</a>(totally depends on individual). After completing first subject and its GATE questions, you can immediately pick the second subject. As soon as two subjects are completely covered, you will start feeling more confident.<br />
                        After completing one subject, the immediately next task should be solving&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-corner-2-gq/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>previously asked GATE questions</strong></a>&nbsp;of that subject. It will help you to uncover weak topics; try to recover those weak topics and resolve those questions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Follow a disciplined schedule :</strong>&nbsp;Make a schedule and follow it at any cost, literally. Decide a fixed number of hours for your GATE preparation and complete it daily; remember, consistency is a compulsion here. Maybe print a calendar from starting day to intended course completion day and stick it front of your study table. Every day you completed those hours, mark the date with green pen and do the same with red pen if you missed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Take running notes while studying:</strong>&nbsp;Note down the important points in notebook while covering the topics. It will definitely help you in revisions. Decide one day in a week to revise one of your previously completed subjects and use your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-cs-notes-gq/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GATE notes</a>here.</li>
                        <li><strong>Subjects easy to score:</strong>&nbsp;There are few subjects which are easier to score, like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/digital-electronics-logic-design-tutorials/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Digital Logic</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/engineering-mathematics-tutorials/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mathematics</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/placements-gq/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Aptitude</a>. These three subjects cover 25-28% of complete GATE paper. Try not to leave these subjects uncovered as they are high scoring and will help to boost your GATE AIR.</li>
                        <li><strong>Track your preparation periodically:</strong>&nbsp;Solve previous GATE question for each subject. It will help you to recall and revise the subjects. We highly recommend giving&nbsp;<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/sudo-gate" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sudo GATE subject-wise Test series</a>&nbsp;since these tests are build on learning while solving approach.</li>
                        <li><strong>Revise and practice are keys to GATE:</strong>&nbsp;After completing each subject, start revising each subject thoroughly. Revise the subject then solve&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-corner-2-gq/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous year GATE questions</a>and take&nbsp;<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/sudo-gate" rel="noopener" target="_blank">subject-wise tests</a>. Remember, the only keys to score good AIR is revise and practice more.</li>
                        <li><strong>Take Mock Tests:</strong>&nbsp;At this final stage of preparation, practicing quality questions before attempting actual GATE will boost your confidence and improve your problem-solving speed. GeeksforGeeks has specially designed&nbsp;<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/sudo-gate" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sudo GATE Mock tests</a>, which will help in boosting your GATE score. Questions in these Mock Test resembles with GATE actual questions and will give the GATE aspirants trailer before the Film.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use short notes :</strong>&nbsp;At this crucial stage, don&rsquo;t try to read any new topic. Just use your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lmns-gq/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Last Minutes Notes</a>&nbsp;to recall only key points in each subject. We highly recommend using these&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lmns-gq/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>LMNs</strong></a>, specially designed for last minutes preparation.</li>

       "title" : "6 Effective GRE Preparation Strategies",
       "text": """<p>Just as the SAT is a standard admissions requirement for undergraduate programs, the GRE General Test is required by graduate programs in most fields. The GRE is not specific to any academic discipline, but it does test your executive functioning skills. Your executive reasoning operates like the CEO of your brain, and the GRE test writers want to see how well that CEO performs in terms of analyzing data, solving problems, and thinking critically.</p>

        <p>Success in the GRE is dependent on your ability to prioritize the information presented to you and organize it in ways that allow you to problem-solve efficiently. The following GRE preparation tips will optimize your performance:</p>

        <h2>1. Read a lot of analytical non-fiction</h2>

        <p>Do you think you could lose weight without avoiding snacks that have more calories than actual nutritional benefits? Properly feeding the mind is based on the same principle, and the best prescription for the health of your GRE skills is a well-balanced diet of reading material.</p>

        <p>Spending time on GRE preparation will be too much of a chore if you don&rsquo;t engage with supplementary analytical non-fiction in your spare time. Studies show that students who ace the verbal section of the GRE are often philosophy or liberal arts majors, who become well-acquainted with many types of narratives and academic writing in their undergraduate coursework.</p>

        <p>Reading about subjects unrelated to your main areas of interest might not be your favorite leisure activity, but the effort will pay off. The GRE&#39;s reading passages require you to become a highly skilled reader of diverse materials, and students who are familiar with a wide variety of texts have a substantial advantage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>2. Adhere to a regular GRE study plan</h2>

        <p>The exact amount of study time necessary for optimal GRE scores varies from person to person, but all students must develop solid command of the test, and this usually takes at least three months of careful GRE preparation. If you have the luxury of extra time, five months would be even better. The most important thing is that you develop a structured study plan and stick to it.</p>

        <p>If you succeeded in your high school math courses and are already an avid reader, you might not need to prepare as much as test-takers with lesser aptitude in these areas, but your background can at best give you a head start. Do not become overconfident, and do not underestimate the GRE.</p>

        <p>Create a realistic daily schedule that designates time for each GRE section, and make sure you cover all of the territory. You are ultimately your own teacher and coach. Just like flossing your teeth regularly prevents inconvenient and costly dental problems, you must preemptively study to ensure a smooth performance on the day of the test.</p>

        <h2>3. Take practice tests</h2>

        <p>When it comes to taking the GRE, one of the major roadblocks is stress. While you may find each section to be manageable on its own, taking the whole test (3 hours and 45 minutes) in one sitting is like running a marathon. You must be prepared and make sure you exercise, stretch, and build your weekly GRE mileage over the span of a few months. Students with insufficient stamina risk low scores.</p>

        <p>Taking practice tests will also help you learn to pace yourself. These will serve as valuable baseline reference points, and taking practice tests is a great way to build testing endurance. Practicing the full GRE will help you develop a feel for the test&#39;s mental and physical demands, which will eventually allow you to work through the entire test confidently and effectively.</p>

        <p>Make sure to take your practice tests under conditions that are as close as possible to an actual GRE administration. You want your brain to become accustomed to taking the test in realistic scenarios.</p>

        <h2>4. Know your weaknesses</h2>

        <p>The areas you find most challenging on the GRE are probably the ones you dislike the most. If you&rsquo;re a math whizz and have no use for verbose writing on esoteric topics, you will probably find swimming through dense prose akin to a quagmire. Conversely, people who find integers and exponential properties tedious usually have to fight tooth and nail to get through math concepts.</p>

        <p>Knowing your weaknesses and how you can chip away at them will allow you to build a balanced pace of study. Do whatever it takes to structure your study plan so that you can target your weaknesses more effectively. It might be awful at first, but it will get less cumbersome.</p>

        <p>When it comes to areas in which you&rsquo;re comfortable, choose study materials that expand your skills and knowledge rather than exercises that are easy for you. The goal is to make yourself focus under the most challenging circumstances by working through material that you find weighty and difficult.</p>

        <h2>5. Chart your progress</h2>

        <p>In job interviews, prospective employers want evidence of how applicants have contributed to work projects. They always appreciate statistical, concrete proof of accomplishment (such as boosting the company&rsquo;s sales by 5% or cutting operational expenses in half).</p>

        <p>GRE prep can also benefit from clear benchmarks of performance. Charting your progress is an absolute necessity, because it will provide an overview of your score improvements and will objectively assess the effectiveness of your study techniques.</p>

        <p>Your metric for improvement should have a consistent set of criteria, and you should measure your progress on a weekly or even daily basis. Regular self-evaluation will illuminate your improvements for each question type and section, and by tracking your study regimen, you&rsquo;ll be able to fix any harmful patterns.</p>

        <h2>6. Trust your gut instinct</h2>

        <p>You&#39;ve probably confronted multiple-choice questions where you&#39;ve narrowed down the options but can&#39;t decide between two plausible answers. You&rsquo;ve analyzed the problem, gathered information, evaluated your choices, and boiled them down to two by process of elimination.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Gut instinct&rdquo; can be a scary concept, since this is merely another way to describe intuition, or the ability to grasp something immediately without cognitive information. When you&rsquo;re taking the GRE, hedging your bets on a 50% success rate (when you&rsquo;ve reduced your answer choices to two) can be a bit unsettling. But if you have thoughtfully and purposefully learned the material and practiced the exercises, then trusting your gut can become a shortcut to making a rational decision.</p>

        <p>As long as you have prepared yourself well and are executing sound test-taking strategies, it&#39;s OK to trust your instinct and carry forward with your intuitive choice. Everyone does a great deal of processing in the subconscious mind, and your gut feeling can help you solve a problem when your conscious mind falters.</p>

<h2><img src="https://www.holidify.com/res/images/patt.png" style="height:30px" />&nbsp;Holidify&#39;s Opinion</h2>

<h2>&nbsp; What&#39;s Great?</h2>

<p>A new hub for the honeymooners. Extremely peaceful place. The pleasant weather is always a delight for the tourists.</p>

<h2>&nbsp; What&#39;s not so Great?</h2>

<p>Public transport for commuting in the local areas is a bit problematic. Also, Munnar does not have its own railway station and airport which makes it difficult to access.</p>

<h2>For Whom</h2>

<p>A very romantic place for the couples and honeymooners. Also, a favourable destination for the nature lovers and trekkers.</p>

<h2>Goa Tourism</h2>

<p>Lying on the west coast, Goa is one of the smallest states in India known for its brilliant beaches, scrumptious food and Portuguese heritage. Panjim, the capital city located in the centre is well-connected with an international airport and roads and trains run from North to South part of Goa.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With a coastline stretching for over 100 kilometres, Goa has numerous beaches that attract millions of visitors. While Baga and Calangute are more popular among the Indian family crowd, Anjuna and Arambol draw a lot of foreign tourists. The beaches in South Goa are relatively lesser explored, but some of them like Agonda and Palolem are more beautiful.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A former Portuguese colony, Goa also boasts of beautiful architecture from the colonial era with many churches and old-style bungalows. The people are quite friendly towards tourists and celebrate many festivals throughout the year. While the seafood is excellent, Goa has one of the best nightlife in the country with trendy bars, beach shacks, elegant cafes and many clubs and discotheques. Thanks to lower alcohol prices in the state, Goa is also great for younger tourists with relatively tighter pockets.</p>

<h2><img src="https://www.holidify.com/res/images/holidify_logo_opinion.png" style="height:30px" />&nbsp;Holidify&#39;s Opinion</h2>

<h2>&nbsp; What&#39;s Great?</h2>

<p>Beautiful beaches and scenery. Get a first hand taste of Portuguese culture and architecture. Amazing nightlife. Frequent music concerts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>&nbsp; What&#39;s not so Great?</h2>

<p>In the peak seasons, Goa can be very crowded. Can be expensive. Summers could be extreme.</p>

<h2>For Whom</h2>

<p>The Party Capital of India, Goa is for anyone who wishes to take a break from their routine life and relax by the beach. From youngsters, spinsters, bachelors, honeymooners to working adults - everyone gets their share of fun at Goa.</p>

<h3>&quot;The city of Taj Mahal, the monument of eternal love&quot;</h3>

<h2>Agra Tourism</h2>

<p>Home to one of the 7 wonders of the world, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.holidify.com/places/agra/taj-mahal-sightseeing-1020.html">Taj Mahal</a>, Agra is a sneak peek into the architectural history with other structures such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.holidify.com/places/agra/agra-fort-sightseeing-1013.html">Agra Fort</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.holidify.com/places/agra/fatehpur-sikri-sightseeing-1015.html">Fatehpur Sikri</a>&nbsp;and hence makes for a must visit for anyone living in or visiting India.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you talk about Agra, one thing has to stand out - yes, the Taj Mahal. Agra is host to the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World in India, Taj Mahal, which makes the whole country proud. But that&#39;s not the only thing Agra has to boast of. Agra has three UNESCO World Heritage sites and Taj Mahal features in the 50 most popular tourist destinations in the world. History, architecture, romance all together create the magic of Agra which is almost the lifeline of Indian tourism. History fanatics as well as architecture buffs can have a ball here with the sheer expanse of the Mughal art and culture on display. Apart from its monuments, the city also has some exciting stuff for foodies - including the famous Agra ka Petha and amazing chaat and Lassi.</p>

<p>Replete with picturesque shimmering beaches, lagoons of turquoise blue waters and a bit of history, Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands is a little slice of paradise tucked around 1,400 km away from the east coast of India. The union territory comprises a total of 572 islands, only 37 of which are inhabited and a few are open to the tourists.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Port Blair, the capital city of Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands, is the gateway to the archipelago and is connected with various islands via multiple daily ferries. Havelock and Neil Island are some of the most famous islands among tourists and is known for pearly white sands, palm-lined shores and offer some of the best snorkelling and diving options in India.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once known for its Cellular Jail- &lsquo;Kaala Paani&rsquo; in Port Blair which primarily imprisoned the freedom fighters who were exiled from the mainland of India during the British Era, the graph of the Andaman and Nicobar islands have lately changed drastically and it is now known for its flourishing tourism industry which especially attracts honeymooners, families and adventure enthusiasts.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You can either laze around on the sandy shores and enjoy the mesmerising sunsets or try your hand at scuba diving and explore the vibrant coral reefs. Besides, it also has virgin immaculate backwaters for those seeking solitude and ataraxy.<br />
<br />
Havelock Island is one of the largest and the most popular attraction of all of Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands. Blessed with pristine beaches and coconut groves, this one offers myriad adventure sports opportunities to its guests. From snorkelling to parasailing, scuba diving and kayaking etc., there is no dearth of thrilling activities here, for that much-needed adrenaline rush, on an otherwise tranquil leisure vacay.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In addition to this, you can visit the bustling city of Port Blair to get a glimpse of the local lifestyle. Steeped in colonial history and boasting of striking architectural monuments, you can also browse the local markets and savour the traditional cuisine.</p>

<h3>&quot;India&#39;s Own Moonland&quot;</h3>

<h2>Leh Ladakh Tourism</h2>

<p>A land like no other with superabundance of attractions to visit and phantasmagoric and fabulous landscapes, amazing people and culture, Ladakh is truly a heaven on Earth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bounded by two of the world&#39;s mightiest mountain ranges, the Great Himalaya and the Karakoram, it lies athwart two other, the Ladakh range and the Zanskar range. Ladakh is mystical in all the spheres it covers, from nature, geography, sceneries to the modest cultures that it fosters. Right from gompas to the sensational momos, the superabundance of attractions to visit makes this city make it heaven on earth. It is said that only in Ladakh can a man sitting in the sun with his feet in the shade suffer from sunstroke and frostbite at the same time.<br />
<br />
For those of us living in the constant confusion about the difference between these twin locations, Leh-Ladakh, here is something that might help you. The state of Jammu and Kashmir is divided into three parts: Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh. Ladakh, further is divided into two districts: district Leh, and district Kargil. The former district has a popular town &ldquo;Leh&rdquo;and is a great tourist attraction because of its beautiful monasteries, picturesque locations, and interesting markets defining the culture of the place.</p>
